        Christopher Nolan is, in my opinion, one of the greatest
        film directors of all time. From the mind-bending storytelling
        of Memento and Inception to jaw-dropping spectacles of
        The Dark Knight and Tenet, he is truly a master of visual storytelling.
        Below are a few of my favorite shots from his best works.

      While many of his films deal with fantastical, larger-than-life stories,
      you would be surprised to hear that many scenes from his films with the most
      awe inspiring visual spectacles are filmed practically without the use of CGI, either with a miniature, a special set,
      or a genuine death-defying stunt. Here are a few examples.
